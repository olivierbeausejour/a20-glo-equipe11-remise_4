PATIONATOR_VISION=Pationator is a software for designing rectangular wooden patio plans. Using a simple and \
  intuitive interface, the application allows the user to design decks that meet Canadian Wood Council standards \
  and view them from three different perspectives. In order to design its terrace plan, the user has the possibility \
  of specifying different characteristics, such as the size of the patio, the types of building materials used and \
  their associated prices, or the spacing between the different constituent parts. The application uses these \
  different properties entered by the user, which can be subsequently modified in real time, to generate a terrace. \
  Thus, the user is directly informed of the validity of his plan according to Canadian standards.\n\nWithin the \
  interface itself, the user can also view the dimensions of each of the parts used. In order to make everything \
  unambiguous and intuitive for the user, these are displayed both in actual size and in theoretical size.\n\nIn \
  addition, for monetary reasons, the software offers the functionality of automatically generating a patio plan \
  at the optimal cost according to certain specifications provided by the user. The latter then directly obtains a \
  plan at the minimum possible cost. When the user wishes, it is possible to save the plan as an image for the \
  different views and to obtain a list of all the parts necessary for the production along with their prices. The \
  plan can also be exported in .STL format to allow viewing of the terrace in various applications, or to make a \
  3D print.\n\nThus, Pationator is a tool that will greatly simplify the work of designers or anyone interested in \
  the design of terraces by its ease of use and its large amount of features.
